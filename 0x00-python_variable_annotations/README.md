# 0x00-python_variable_annotations

This project covers Python variable annotations, type hints, and static typing using the `typing` module. Each task demonstrates the use of type annotations for functions, variables, and more complex types.

## Tasks
- Basic type annotations for functions and variables
- Using `List`, `Tuple`, `Union`, `Callable`, and `TypeVar` from `typing`
- Duck typing and advanced type hints
- All files are executable and follow PEP8/pycodestyle

## Usage
Each `.py` file can be run independently. See the task descriptions for expected function signatures and behaviors.
