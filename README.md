# ALX Backend Python

This repository contains Python projects for the ALX Backend course. Each project explores different backend concepts and Python programming techniques, with a focus on type annotations, asynchronous programming, and best practices.

## Projects

### 0x00-python_variable_annotations
Covers Python type annotations and variable typing.
- Type-annotated functions for addition, concatenation, flooring, and more
- Safe element access and type checking
- Example of variable definition and type hints

### 0x01-python_async_function
Introduces asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`.
- Writing and running async coroutines
- Executing multiple coroutines concurrently
- Measuring async runtime
- Working with asyncio tasks

## Usage
- Each project folder contains its own README and Python scripts.
- Run scripts with Python 3.7+.
- All code follows PEP8/pycodestyle and is type-annotated.
